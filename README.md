# Restauraunt Website For Local Bistro - Linda. 

This is a website dedicated to a local bistro named Linda, in my town Ashkelon. 
This is built as a **gesture** and for my own practice sake. 

This has been built with mainly HTML and CSS with very little JS.

**Tools that were used:**
* PUG - Templating for HTML
* SASS - Preprocessor for CSS. I really like this one, it's amazingly convinient syntax and features. 
* Vanilla JavaScript - no jQuery/React etc.. 
* Gulp - I've used it for BrowserSync, For script injection (experimenting), and mainly for the build before deployment, even though it's a really small project that can probably live without minification/concatenation, it was great learning experience and lots of broken teeth and spitted blood :D :D
